# Tech Nation Evidence – Samuel Agyekum

This repository curates links to my most relevant public technical work demonstrating:
- applied machine learning and explainability
- reproducible engineering practice
- security + governance thinking for data systems
- cross-domain testing (generalisation)

## Evidence highlights (quick scan)

### 1) Multi-sport player performance analytics (flagship)
- Repo: https://github.com/agyekumboadi/msc-dissertation-player-performance-analytics
- Demonstrates: end-to-end ML pipeline, PCA, evaluation, SHAP explainability, cross-sport testing
- Outputs: ROC AUC reporting, confusion matrices, SHAP plots, reproducible structure

### 2) Information Security Strategy
- Repo: https://github.com/agyekumboadi/msc-information-security-strategy
- Demonstrates: risk thinking, governance alignment, security-aware analytics perspective

### 3) IS Governance (regulated environment)
- Repo: https://github.com/agyekumboadi/msc-info-sys-governance
- Demonstrates: governance frameworks, audit readiness, compliance mapping

## Reproducibility note
